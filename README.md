## Vision
> Create Next Generation Web2+3 DID Social Gateway

## Values
> Connect Your Web2+3 Ids, Links, Works, Data, Contracts, etc.

We mainly help web2+3 creators, web3 builders and communities, web3 investors/developers/organizations and other user groups to open up and aggregate account IDs under many App application systems, and integrate on-chain and off-chain data into Personalized application in a centralized way. Based on a set of Nextme DIDs to connect users' web2+3 social IDs, works, assets, contracts, etc., select and personalize their homepage from several vertical career templates, not limited to social media business cards, NFT/DAO/Club and other tokens Mint/AirDrop/Poap aggregated business page, community community Member Pass center, etc. While helping 200 million+ individual creators and 10w+ small and medium-sized web2+3 organizations around the world to build and aggregate their own web2+3 homepages and communities, it also greatly reduces the cost of portal building for a brand or product to be released and sold. the average cost of designing front-end and back-end contracts is 3-5 manpower/tens of thousands of dollars. In the follow-up plan, the Nextme DID Network API and portrait protocol will be opened to developers and toB organizations for on-chain user portrait analysis and accurate delivery.
